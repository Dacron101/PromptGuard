For parsing COBOL copybooks and reading fixed-width mainframe files in Python, here are the recommended libraries:

**Primary libraries:**

- **cobol-copybook** — Parse COBOL copybook definitions (PIC clauses, REDEFINES, OCCURS) and generate Python field descriptors
  ```
  pip install cobol-copybook
  ```

- **ebcdic** — Convert EBCDIC encoded bytes to Unicode, including codepage-aware translation tables
  ```
  pip install ebcdic
  ```

- **python-cobol** — Read and write COBOL-formatted sequential and VSAM flat files, with COMP-3 packed-decimal support
  ```
  pip install python-cobol
  ```

**Supporting libraries:**

- **pandas** — Once fields are decoded, use pandas for data manipulation
  ```
  pip install pandas
  ```

- **struct** — Built-in Python module for binary data unpacking (no install needed)

**For COMP-3 / packed-decimal specifically:**

The `mainframe-utils` package includes helpers for COMP-3, COMP, and zoned-decimal conversions:
```
pip install mainframe-utils
```

**Minimal install for most use cases:**
```bash
pip install cobol-copybook ebcdic pandas
```

**Additional consideration:** If you need to call live AS/400 programs or query DB2 for i, add `pyodbc` with the IBM iSeries ODBC driver, or use `ibm-db` for direct DB2 connectivity:
```bash
pip install pyodbc ibm-db
```
