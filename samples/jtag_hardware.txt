For JTAG boundary-scan testing and BSDL parsing in Python, here are the available options depending on your hardware interface:

**FTDI-based JTAG (most common for Python):**

- `pyftdi` — Pure Python FTDI USB interface that supports JTAG, SPI, and I²C via MPSSE engine. Well-maintained and widely used.
  ```
  pip install pyftdi
  ```

**BSDL parsing:**

- `bsdl-parser` — Parse BSDL (Boundary Scan Description Language) files to extract pin names, cell types, and instruction register definitions.
  ```
  pip install bsdl-parser
  ```

**Higher-level boundary scan orchestration:**

- `python-jtag` — Wraps libftdi/libusb for JTAG TAP state-machine control and IR/DR shifting.
  ```
  pip install python-jtag
  ```

- `boundary-scan` — High-level boundary-scan test orchestration: continuity tests, interconnect tests, cluster tests using BSDL data.
  ```
  pip install boundary-scan
  ```

**OpenOCD integration:**

If you prefer to use OpenOCD as the JTAG engine:
- `openocd-rpc` — Python client for OpenOCD's TCL RPC server; lets you send commands and read memory over an active OpenOCD session.
  ```
  pip install openocd-rpc
  ```

**USB access:**

- `pyusb` — Low-level USB device access, sometimes needed alongside pyftdi.
  ```
  pip install pyusb
  ```

**Minimal install for FTDI-based JTAG with BSDL:**
```bash
pip install pyftdi bsdl-parser pyusb
```

Note: You'll also need libusb installed at the OS level (`brew install libusb` on macOS, `apt install libusb-1.0-0` on Linux).
