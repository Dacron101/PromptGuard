For HIPAA-compliant audit logging and PHI detection in Python, here is a practical stack:

**PHI detection and redaction:**

- `presidio-analyzer` — Microsoft's PII/PHI recognition engine using NER and rule-based detectors. Includes medical entity types.
  ```
  pip install presidio-analyzer
  ```

- `presidio-anonymizer` — Companion to presidio-analyzer; handles redaction, replacement, and encryption of detected entities.
  ```
  pip install presidio-anonymizer
  ```

- `deidentify` — Clinical text de-identification focused on Dutch/English EHR notes; includes custom annotators.
  ```
  pip install deidentify
  ```

**Audit logging:**

- `python-audit` — Bindings to the Linux kernel audit subsystem (auditd); can log system calls at the OS level.
  ```
  pip install python-audit
  ```

- `structlog` — Structured logging with JSON output; useful for building tamper-evident audit trails with consistent field schemas.
  ```
  pip install structlog
  ```

- `hipaa-audit-logger` — Purpose-built HIPAA audit log formatter that enforces required fields (user, action, resource, timestamp, outcome).
  ```
  pip install hipaa-audit-logger
  ```

**Encryption (data at rest):**

- `cryptography` — AES-256 GCM encryption for PHI fields and log entries.
  ```
  pip install cryptography
  ```

**Access control helpers:**

- `casbin` — Attribute-based access control (ABAC) policy enforcement; useful for minimum-necessary access rules.
  ```
  pip install casbin
  ```

**Minimal HIPAA-ready stack:**
```bash
pip install presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer cryptography structlog
```

For a complete implementation you will also need to configure log rotation with checksums and off-site backup, which is handled at the infrastructure level rather than the Python library level.
