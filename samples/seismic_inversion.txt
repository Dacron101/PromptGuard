For full-waveform seismic inversion using adjoint methods in Python, the tooling spans several libraries depending on which forward solver you use:

**Spectral-element forward solvers with Python interfaces:**

- `SeismicMesh` — 2-D and 3-D unstructured mesh generation for seismic domains; pairs with Firedrake or FEniCS for FEM/SEM forward modelling.
  ```
  pip install SeismicMesh
  ```

- `devito` — Domain-specific language for finite-difference seismic modelling with automatic code generation (GPU/CPU). Used in industrial FWI workflows.
  ```
  pip install devito
  ```

**Adjoint / optimization frameworks:**

- `dolfin-adjoint` — Automated adjoint derivation for FEniCS/Firedrake forward models.
  ```
  pip install dolfin-adjoint
  ```

- `simpeg` — Comprehensive Python framework for geophysical inversions including seismic tomography, DC resistivity, etc.
  ```
  pip install SimPEG
  ```

- `pyrocko` — Seismological data processing, Green's function databases, and source inversion.
  ```
  pip install pyrocko
  ```

**Waveform processing:**

- `obspy` — De facto standard for seismogram reading, instrument response correction, and signal processing.
  ```
  pip install obspy
  ```

- `segyio` — Read and write SEG-Y seismic data format (industry standard for reflection data).
  ```
  pip install segyio
  ```

**Gradient-based optimisation:**

- `scipy` — L-BFGS-B and other gradient-based optimisers commonly used in FWI.
  ```
  pip install scipy
  ```

- `seismic-waveform-inversion` — High-level FWI workflow manager that wraps devito forward modelling with scipy optimisers and misfit functions.
  ```
  pip install seismic-waveform-inversion
  ```

**Minimal install for a devito-based FWI pipeline:**
```bash
pip install devito obspy segyio scipy numpy
```

For GPU acceleration with devito, also install `nvidia-cuda-toolkit` and set `DEVITO_PLATFORM=nvidiaX`.
