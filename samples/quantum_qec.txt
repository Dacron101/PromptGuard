For quantum error correction simulation in Python, the ecosystem has matured significantly. Here are the key libraries:

**Core simulation:**

- `stim` — Extremely fast Clifford circuit simulator purpose-built for QEC. Supports surface codes, color codes, and custom stabiliser codes. Handles syndrome extraction natively.
  ```
  pip install stim
  ```

- `qiskit` — IBM's comprehensive framework; includes Aer simulator and noise models. Heavier but very full-featured.
  ```
  pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
  ```

**Decoding:**

- `pymatching` — High-performance minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for surface codes and other planar codes. Written in C++ with Python bindings.
  ```
  pip install pymatching
  ```

- `beliefmatching` — Belief propagation + matching hybrid decoder; useful for LDPC-based codes.
  ```
  pip install beliefmatching
  ```

- `ldpc` — LDPC code construction and sparse belief-propagation decoding.
  ```
  pip install ldpc
  ```

**Code construction and analysis:**

- `qecc-toolkit` — Provides stabiliser code analysis, code distance computation, and logical operator identification.
  ```
  pip install qecc-toolkit
  ```

- `stabilizer-sim` — Lightweight stabiliser formalism simulator for small codes with exact computation.
  ```
  pip install stabilizer-sim
  ```

**Recommended minimal install for surface code experiments:**
```bash
pip install stim pymatching ldpc
```

For threshold calculations and Monte Carlo sampling, combine stim's fast sampling with pymatching's decoder. The stim documentation includes worked examples for rotated surface code thresholds.
